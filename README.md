# Harpagan.com: A Visual AI Research Agent for Critical Thinking in the Information Age

**Executive Summary:**

Harpagan is a revolutionary Visual AI Research Agent designed to combat the growing problems of online information overload, bias, and misinformation.  It empowers users to bypass traditional, often flawed, search engine results by enabling direct, visual interaction with on-screen content.  Through a Chrome extension (and compatible with all Chromium-based browsers like Opera, Edge, and Brave) and web app, users can select any visible area – text, images, charts, diagrams, or application elements – and instantly analyze it using advanced AI.  Harpagan provides concise, source-verified answers, leveraging the power of Google's Gemini LLM, Google Vertex web search, and a transparent, pay-per-use model powered by the Solana blockchain.

**Problem Statement: The Crisis of Online Information**

The modern internet is plagued by a crisis of credibility and efficiency.  Traditional search engines, while powerful, are increasingly compromised by:

*   **Ad Saturation:**  Results are dominated by paid advertisements, obscuring organic and genuinely relevant content.
*   **Pay-Per-Click Bias:**  Search rankings are heavily influenced by advertising budgets, prioritizing the highest bidders over the most authoritative sources.
*   **AI-Generated Content Flood:**  The proliferation of low-quality, AI-generated articles and websites creates "noise," making it difficult to discern authentic information.
*   **SEO Manipulation:**  Aggressive SEO tactics artificially inflate website rankings, regardless of content quality or user value.
*   **Lack of Source Verification:**  Search results often lack clear citations and source credibility indicators, forcing users into time-consuming manual verification.
*  **Limited Contextual Understanding:** Traditional keyword-based search struggles to handle specific elements within images, charts, or complex visual data.

These issues waste users' time, erode trust in online information, and contribute to the spread of misinformation.

**Harpagan's Solution: Visual AI-Powered Research**

Harpagan directly addresses these challenges by offering a fundamentally different approach to online research:

1.  **Visual Selection & Contextual Inquiry:** Harpagan's core innovation is its visual selection capability.  Users can select *any* visible area on their screen using a simple shortcut (Alt+Q).  This allows for precise targeting of information, surpassing the limitations of text-based search.  Users then provide a text prompt (e.g., "Summarize this," "Explain this chart," "Find sources for this claim") to guide the AI's analysis.

2.  **AI-Powered Analysis & Source Verification:** Harpagan leverages the power of:
    *   **Google's Gemini LLM:**  For advanced natural language understanding and generation.
    *   **Google Vertex Web Search:**  To access a broad range of online information.
    *   **Prompt-Chaining:**  A sophisticated technique that guides the LLM through a series of steps to ensure accurate and relevant results.
    *   **Crucially, Harpagan provides direct citations and links to the original sources for every answer, enabling easy verification and combating misinformation.**

3.  **Transparent & Affordable Pay-Per-Use Model (Solana Blockchain):**  Harpagan rejects the subscription model and ad-supported approaches.  Instead, it uses a transparent, pay-per-use system powered by the Solana blockchain:
    *   **Phantom Wallet Integration:**  Users connect their Phantom wallet to purchase credits using SOL.
    *   **Dynamic Pricing:**  Credits are priced in USD, converted to SOL at the real-time exchange rate (via Binance API), ensuring fairness and reflecting market conditions.
    *   **Fast & Low-Cost Transactions:**  Solana's speed and low transaction fees provide a seamless and cost-effective payment experience.
    *   **Direct Wallet-to-Wallet Transfers:** Transactions are secure and verifiable, with SOL sent directly from the user's wallet to Harpagan's.
    * **Bonus credits** Larger purchase get bonus credits.
    * **Minimum transaction limit** Minimum transaction of 0.00125 SOL.

4.  **User-Friendly Interface & Accessibility:**
    *   **Chrome Extension:**  Provides seamless integration with the user's browsing workflow.  Compatible with all Chromium-based browsers (Opera, Edge, Brave, etc.).
    *   **Web App:**  Allows users to manage their credits and API keys.
    *   **API Key Management (for Teams):**  Facilitates usage tracking and control within organizations, with options for setting limits and expiry dates.

5.  **Robust Technology Stack:**
    *   **Backend:** FastAPI (Python), RHEL, Docker, Redis, PostgreSQL.
    *   **Frontend:** Next.js/TypeScript.
    *   **Chrome Extension:** JavaScript/CSS.
    *   **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions and CapRover.
    *   **Solana Integration:**  `@solana/wallet-adapter-react`, `@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui`, `@solana/web3.js`, `trpc/react`.
